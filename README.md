**Hi, I'm Jose 👋**

I'm a United States Army Veteran turned Software Engineer. While serving as a *Field Artillery Automated Tactical Data System Specialist* I ensured that the five requirements for achieving accurate first-round fire on a target were always met. I now spend my time creating innovative solutions for real world problems that need solving. 👨‍💻
